# Pastebin-Mini-Demo
A Pastebin-like web service built with Spring Boot, enabling users to store plain text and retrieve it via unique, short URLs. Supports custom URLs, expiration times, and a simple Key Generation Service (KGS) to ensure unique URL hashes. Inspired by "Designing Pastebin" and system design principles from "System Design Interview" books.
